# Copper&Claw Development Log

## Project Overview

Copper&Claw is a standalone Guild Wars 2 Nexus Trading Post watcher.

The project began by extracting the already-working Trading Post framework that had been developed inside FoodReminder-Nexus into a new standalone addon. Copper&Claw is now maintained as its own separate project.

Display name: `Copper&Claw`  
Filesystem/data prefix: `CopperAndClaw`  
Current development version: `0.1.0`

---

## 2026-09-03 — Standalone Project Created

Created a new Visual Studio DLL project for Copper&Claw.

Initial project name: `Copper & Claw`

Configured:

- x64
- Dynamic Library
- Platform Toolset v143
- C++17
- Multi-Byte Character Set
- `/MP`
- no precompiled headers
- Debug `/MTd`
- Release `/MT`
- Windows subsystem
- UAC disabled

Initial build issues were caused by stale ImGui source references pointing outside the standalone project. The ImGui source references were removed and re-added from the correct project-local `imgui` folder.

**Result: Release x64 build passed.**

Current generated DLL: `Copper & Claw.dll`

---

## 2026-09-03 — Trading Post Framework Extracted

Copied the working Trading Post framework from FoodReminder-Nexus into Copper&Claw.

Core files include:

- `entry.cpp`
- `Settings.h`
- `Settings.cpp`
- `TradingPostUI.h`
- `TradingPostUI.cpp`
- `TradingPostWatchManager.h`
- `TradingPostWatchManager.cpp`
- `TradingPostPriceManager.h`
- `TradingPostPriceManager.cpp`
- `TradingPostHistoryManager.h`
- `TradingPostHistoryManager.cpp`
- `TradingPostItemIndexManager.h`
- `TradingPostItemIndexManager.cpp`

Standalone persistence names were changed to:

- `CopperAndClaw.ini`
- `CopperAndClaw_TradingPostWatch.ini`
- `CopperAndClaw_TradingPostHistory.tsv`
- `CopperAndClaw_TradingPostItemIndex.tsv`

HTTP user-agent changed to `CopperAndClaw/1.0`.

---

## 2026-09-03 — Standalone Nexus Entry Point

Created a standalone `entry.cpp`.

Current addon metadata:

- Name: `Copper&Claw`
- Version: `0.1.0`
- Author: `spectre9510`
- Description: Trading Post watch/history/trends/alerts

Startup initializes Settings, Price Manager, History Manager, Item Index Manager, and Watch Manager.

Nexus render and options-render callbacks are registered. Shutdown saves settings and shuts down the Trading Post systems.

Current standalone signature:

`(uint32_t)-26090301`

Decision: keep the current unique negative signature for standalone/non-Raidcore use.

If Copper&Claw is later hosted through Raidcore, replace it with the signature assigned by Raidcore.

---

## 2026-09-03 — First In-Game Standalone Test

Copper&Claw loaded successfully through Nexus.

Verified:

- addon recognized by Nexus
- Copper&Claw options panel opens
- Trading Post UI renders
- Aurene's Bite loads
- sell price populates
- buy price populates
- 60-second automatic watch cycle runs
- Trading Post item index builds successfully
- trend/history system is active

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Multiple Watch Items Tested

Added multiple items to the watch list.

Functionality worked, but the original Trading Post layout became visually cluttered when several watched items were displayed.

Decision: redesign the main watch-list display into a compact item layout.

---

## 2026-09-03 — Compact Watch-List UI

Redesigned each watched item into a compact presentation.

Changes:

- item name made more prominent
- current sell price kept visible
- current buy price kept visible
- status kept visible
- Refresh / Remove actions kept visible
- Details / History collapsed by default
- trend data moved inside Details / History
- market information moved inside Details / History
- Spread information moved inside Details / History
- signals moved inside Details / History
- charts and historical statistics moved inside Details / History

The same compact layout was also ported back into FoodReminder-Nexus.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Sell Target Visibility Fix

After the compact redesign, the Sell Target controls were still functional but had been moved inside the collapsed Details / History section.

Changed the compact main item row to keep the Sell Target gold/silver/copper controls directly visible. The duplicate target editor inside Details / History was removed.

The same target-row change was also prepared for FoodReminder-Nexus.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Persistence Testing

Performed a full game restart with watched items already configured.

Verified:

- watched items persisted
- Trading Post item index loaded from cache without rebuilding
- existing history remained available
- new observations continued to accumulate after restart

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Target Alert Testing

Sell Target functionality tested in-game.

Verified:

- target value can be entered directly from the compact item row
- a qualifying fresh Trading Post observation triggers the alert
- active target state is shown in the watch list
- Dismiss Party clears the active alert
- multiple triggered target alerts are queued
- dismissing one alert advances to the next queued alert

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Target Alert UI Redesign

The original celebratory target overlay worked but was visually cramped.

Redesigned the alert into a taller card-style layout with clearer hierarchy:

1. TARGET REACHED!
2. item name
3. CURRENT SELL
4. YOUR TARGET
5. Dismiss Party

Removed the redundant explanatory sentence indicating that the current sell was at or below the target.

Preserved the Dragon Bash-style celebration:

- animated confetti
- animated burst effects
- pulsing celebratory border
- Dismiss Party button

The current dark card background may receive additional cosmetic polish later.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Duplicate-Name Trading Post Item Discovery

Testing uncovered an important Trading Post search issue with items that share the same display name but use different item IDs and have separate Trading Post listings.

Example tested:

`Festive Confetti Infusion`

Searching for this item returned several entries with the same visible name but different item IDs.

Because each variant has its own Trading Post listing and price, choosing an entry by item ID alone made it difficult to know which stat variant was actually being watched.

This could cause the Copper&Claw price to appear incorrect when compared against a different stat variant opened in the in-game Trading Post.

The Trading Post price lookup itself was correct; the problem was item identification in the search/autocomplete interface.

---

## 2026-09-03 — Variant-Aware Trading Post Search

Extended the Trading Post item index so searchable items can carry an optional stat/variant label in addition to:

- item ID
- item name

The item index now reads stat attribute metadata from the Guild Wars 2 item API and uses it to distinguish duplicate-name Trading Post items.

The local cache format was expanded to store:

- item ID
- item name
- variant label

Search text also includes the variant label, allowing searches to identify a specific version more easily.

Example concept:

`Festive Confetti Infusion - Power`

instead of:

`Festive Confetti Infusion (Item ID: 84882)`

When a variant-aware search result is added to the watch list, the variant label is retained in the watched-item name.

Legacy item-index cache rows remain readable, but an older cache without variant information triggers a background rebuild so the new metadata can be populated.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Player-Friendly Variant Labels

The first variant-aware implementation exposed raw Guild Wars 2 API attribute names.

Examples included:

- `AgonyResistance / Power`
- `AgonyResistance / BoonDuration`
- `AgonyResistance / ConditionDuration`

This worked technically but made autocomplete results longer and less readable than necessary.

Added player-facing attribute formatting.

Current mappings include:

- `Power` → `Power`
- `Precision` → `Precision`
- `Toughness` → `Toughness`
- `Vitality` → `Vitality`
- `Ferocity` → `Ferocity`
- `ConditionDamage` → `Condition Damage`
- `Healing` → `Healing Power`
- `BoonDuration` → `Concentration`
- `ConditionDuration` → `Expertise`
- `AgonyResistance` → omitted from the visible variant label

The item-index cache was manually removed once during testing so the new labels could be rebuilt immediately.

After the rebuild, Festive Confetti Infusion autocomplete results displayed cleanly as:

- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Power`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Vitality`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Expertise`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Precision`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Toughness`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Concentration`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Healing Power`
- `Festive Confetti Infusion - Condition Damage`

The results are now short enough to scan easily while still identifying the exact Trading Post listing being watched.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-03 — Git Repository / Documentation Setup

Initialized a Git repository for Copper&Claw and pushed the standalone project to GitHub.

The repository root contains the Visual Studio solution, project folder, README, and development log.

Added:

- `README.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`

The documentation files were initially referenced by Visual Studio from outside the repository and therefore did not appear on GitHub.

They were moved into the repository root, re-added to the Visual Studio project, committed, and pushed successfully.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — Market Analysis Accuracy Review

Reviewed the original Deal / Signal logic after live in-game examples showed misleading combinations.

A key issue was identified:

A rising sell trend could cause the old system to label an item overpriced or cautionary even when the current price was still below its recent average.

Decision:

Price position should carry more weight than trend direction.

A rising price alone should not automatically mean an item is overpriced.

Example logic direction:

- below average + falling/stable → favorable
- below average + rising → worth watching
- near average + rising → watch
- above average + rising → caution
- well above average + rising → stronger caution

This became the basis for the next market-analysis redesign.

---

## 2026-09-04 — Separate Sell Listings / Buy Orders Analysis

The old combined market terminology could look contradictory because Sell Listings and Buy Orders mean different things.

Example:

- Sell listing rising = buyers must pay more
- Buy order rising = sellers can receive more

Decision: analyze both sides separately.

New sections:

### SELL LISTINGS

Displays:

- Direction
- Recent Avg
- Price Position
- For Buyers

Possible direction wording includes:

- Getting More Expensive
- Getting Cheaper
- Stable
- Developing

Buyer-facing signals include:

- Favorable
- Worth Watching
- Typical
- Caution
- Developing

### BUY ORDERS

Displays:

- Direction
- Recent Avg
- Price Position
- For Sellers

Possible direction wording includes:

- Buyers Offering More
- Buyers Offering Less
- Stable
- Developing

Seller-facing signals include:

- Favorable
- Worth Watching
- Typical
- Weak
- Developing

Shared information includes:

- Confidence
- Coverage
- Samples
- Spread

This removed the confusing appearance of Sell and Buy information contradicting each other.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — Direction Percentages Added

Added percentage change next to Sell Listing and Buy Order direction labels.

Examples:

`Getting More Expensive (+1.19%)`

`Buyers Offering More (+0.38%)`

The compact watched-item summary now also includes the direction percentages.

Example:

`Listings: More Expensive +1.19% | Buy Orders: Higher +0.38% | Conf HIGH`

Recent-average comparison percentages remain visible separately.

Decision: do not add additional percentages to signals or confidence so the interface remains readable.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — Confidence / Coverage Presentation

Market analysis now presents maturity information so newly tracked items are not treated as if they have complete long-term history.

Current analysis considers:

- number of observations
- available history span
- selected trend window
- whether the selected window comparison is available
- selected-window coverage

Current minimum analysis sample floor:

`15`

Current readiness threshold:

`75%` selected-window coverage

Current high-confidence threshold:

`90%` selected-window coverage

Confidence labels:

- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH

The UI also shows:

- Coverage
- Samples

This is intended to make the limitations of locally collected data visible instead of presenting early analysis with false certainty.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — Historical Data Disclaimer Added

Copper&Claw does not have external historical Trading Post data from before an item begins being tracked.

Added a global UI notice near the Trend Window:

`Historical note: Copper&Claw builds its own price history from the time you begin tracking an item.`

`No earlier market history is available on initial install.`

Developing analysis can also display:

`Analysis is based only on locally collected history.`

This clarifies that longer trend windows become meaningful only after enough local observations have been collected.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — In-App Heading Cleanup

The main Trading Post panel still displayed the inherited heading:

`Trading Post Watcher`

This was a leftover from the original FoodReminder-Nexus Trading Post framework.

Changed the visible heading to:

`Copper&Claw`

No functional logic was changed.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2026-09-04 — DLL Naming Decision

Reviewed whether the Visual Studio build target should be renamed from:

`Copper & Claw.dll`

to:

`CopperAndClaw.dll`

Decision: keep the current DLL filename.

Current naming:

- Visual Studio project: `Copper & Claw`
- DLL: `Copper & Claw.dll`
- user-facing addon name: `Copper&Claw`
- persistence/data prefix: `CopperAndClaw`

No build-target rename is currently planned.

---

## 2026-09-04 — Nexus Signature Decision

Reviewed the current development signature:

`(uint32_t)-26090301`

Decision: retain the current unique negative signature for standalone/non-Raidcore use.

If Copper&Claw is later hosted through Raidcore, replace it with the positive signature assigned by Raidcore.

The earlier documentation note saying the signature must always be replaced before public release is no longer considered accurate for a standalone release.

---

## 2026-09-04 — Full Restart / Persistence Validation

Performed another full Guild Wars 2 restart using the current Copper&Claw build after the market-analysis changes.

Before restart, verified:

- multiple watched items
- Sell Targets configured
- Trend Window set to `6h`
- existing observation counts/history

After restart, verified:

- watched items remained
- Sell Targets remained
- Trend Window remained `6h`
- historical observations remained
- observation counts continued increasing
- local history remained intact
- current market analysis rendered normally

**Result: PASS**

---

## Current Known Notes / Decisions Still Open

### Aurene's Bite default item

Aurene's Bite is currently hard-coded as the default watched item.

Item ID: `96356`

Because it is marked as the default item, the UI does not offer a Remove button for it.

Decision still open:

- keep Aurene's Bite as the permanent default
- or make all watched items fully removable

### DLL / project naming

Current Visual Studio project: `Copper & Claw`  
Current DLL: `Copper & Claw.dll`  
User-facing addon display name: `Copper&Claw`

Decision: keep the current DLL/project naming.

### Target alert appearance

The redesigned target alert is functionally good and clearer to read.

The current dark card background may receive additional cosmetic polish later.

### Item-index cache format

The Trading Post item-index cache includes variant labels.

Older cache files without variant metadata remain readable, but they trigger a rebuild so the cache can be upgraded to the current format.

### Local history limitation

Copper&Claw builds its own local price-history database.

No historical market data exists for periods before an item began being tracked locally.

New installations therefore begin with no historical market data.

### Market-analysis confidence

Current confidence uses locally available history span, selected trend window, observation count, and coverage thresholds.

Further refinement may be considered later if testing shows that long offline gaps cause coverage to appear more complete than the actual observation density.

### Nexus signature

Current standalone signature:

`(uint32_t)-26090301`

Decision: retain for standalone/non-Raidcore use.

Replace only if Copper&Claw later receives an assigned Raidcore signature.

## Development Rule

When making future Copper&Claw changes, use the current project files as the source of truth.

Do not substitute older copies of files from prior work.

When a current source file is needed for modification, request the current file first, even if that same file was edited or supplied earlier in the current development session.
